## Hi there ğŸ‘‹[Please Read]
<!--
**ZionSokoya/ZionSokoya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile.
My name is Zion (she) Obviously ğŸ˜‚
I recently began my journey in Front-end Development after graduating from Covenant University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering ğŸ˜­.
Diving into this world has made me more grateful for the work that goes into creating a website and even app development.
Learning about the things that actually make things work has been exciting ğŸ˜‚ ğŸ˜‚. I love it!
âš¡ Fun Fact about Me :I was born to be a billionaireğŸ˜‚,travelling the world,trying out new restaurants and taking pictures with friends but forced to be where I am rn.
But I'm getting there ğŸ˜‚.Another fun fact...Let me see I wanted to be a pilot sometime in my life (a few years ago ğŸ˜‚),a doctor in my primary school and an engineer then a model ğŸ˜‚.
Honestly I have always been fascinated with computers since I was a kid. I would go through all the settings on my dad's phones and laptop just to see how things worked ğŸ˜‚.
Now the last fun fact is my love for sitcoms....I believe Modern Family is the best sitcom ever (sorry to HIMYM and Friends fans ğŸ˜‚), real close is Brookly nine-nine and I love to just have them play in the background while I work it helps me relax ğŸ˜….
Anywayssss,
